## Instruction

Run Monash (RM) is a running carnival which is held on separate dates at various Monash
campuses during different seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter and Spring) of the year. The
carnival naming convention that Run Monash uses is RM <season name> Series <campus
name> <year>. So, for example, a carnival to be held during the Autumn season at the
Clayton campus in 2022 will be named RM Autumn Series Clayton 2022.
  
Anyone can attend an RM Carnival, the carnivals are open to the public as well as Monash
staff and students. A carnival is run on a particular date, in a particular location and only
lasts for one day. RM only runs one carnival on any particular date. During a carnival a range
of events are offered from the following list (only some may be offered):
* Marathon 42.2 Km
* Half Marathon 21.1 Km
* 10 Km Run
* 5 Km Run
* 3 Km Community Run/Walk
  
Run Monash expects to offer around 10 - 20 such events across all carnivals in a given year.
When a competitor initially registers for Run Monash, they are assigned a unique competitor
number. A competitor is required to provide details of an emergency contact at the time of
registration. The relationship to the competitor can be Parent (P), Guardian (G), Partner (T)
or Friend (F).
  
When a carnival is being offered, Run Monash contacts all registered competitors and
provides details of the carnival date and what events are on offer. Competitors can only
enter once for each type of event at a carnival. Every entry is assigned an entry number. The
entry number is reused in each event. Run Monash also, on the carnival day, using official
timing devices, Run Monash records the entrants starting and finishing times.
  
Teams are identified by a unique team name which the team manager must select when
they first create the team. This team manager can then add/invite other competitors from the
carnival to join their team. Team names are unique only within a given carnival, A given team
name may be reused by different competitors in a different carnival as teams are recreated
for each carnival depending on which competitors have entered an event for the carnival.
  
Run Monash wishes to record, as part of the stored data, how many members are on each
team. Teams may also nominate a charity for which they will raise funds, although not all
teams will do so. All charities for which funds can be raised must first be approved by Run
Monash. Note that an individual competitor may be supporting a charity as an individual and
also the same or a different charity as a team member.

A model to represent this system has been developed:

## Purpose

implement, via SQL, a small database in the Oracle
RDBMS from a provided logical model case study, followed by the insert of
appropriate data to the created tables. Once populated the database will be used
to: carry out specified DML commands and make specified changes to the
database structure via SQL.

## Criteria

* Application of relational database principles.
* Handling of transactions and the setting of appropriate transaction
boundaries.
* Application of SQL statements and constructs to create and alter tables
including the required constraints and column comments, populate tables,
modify existing data in tables, and modify the "live" database structure to
meet the expressed requirements (including appropriate use of
constraints).
